# JavaScript Refresher - Basic

Write JavaScript programs to complete the following tasks.


1.  Display the current day and time with the following format:  Today is Sunday. The current time is 9 AM : 50 : 22
2.  Find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three sides are 5, 7, 8.
3.  Scroll the string 'Origin Code Academy Rocks! ' from left to right by periodically (every 100 miliseconds) removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front. 
4.  Determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar. Hint: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.
5.  Take as input a random integer between 1 to 10. The user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Try again".
6.  Calculate the number of days left until next Christmas.
7.  Convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ] 
Expected Output : 
60째C is 140 째F
45째F is 7.2222째C 
8.  Calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user) using a simple form like this: <img src="http://imgur.com/wkVaCWy" />
9.  Accept as input and sort three numbers. Display an alert box to show the result. 
Sample input : 4, 0, -1 
Output : 1-, 0, 4 
10. Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.
Sample Output : 
"0 is even" 
"1 is odd" 
"2 is even"
11. Iterate through and print the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
12. Construct the following diagram using a nested for loop:

^  
^ ^  
^ ^ ^  
^ ^ ^ ^  
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
13. According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process: 
"Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)". 
Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers.
14. Given the following tables, calculate the average mark and grade of the class:  <img src="http://imgur.com/YWNAOXa" />
15. Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number.
Example x = 32243;
Expected Output: 3422316
16. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.
Example string: 'dog' 
Expected Output: d,do,dog,o,og,g
17. Write a JavaScript function that accepts, sorts and returns a string in alphabetical order.
Example string: 'webmaster' 
Expected Output: 'abeemrstw'
18. Write a JavaScript function which accepts an argument and returns its type.
Note: There are six possible values to return: object, boolean, function, number, string, or undefined.
19. Pass a "Hello World" JavaScript function as parameter to another function. Display with a test call.
20. A bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
Array: [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213]
Expected output : [3223, 546, 455, 345, 234, 213, 122, 98, 84, 64, 23, 12, 9, 4, 1]
